/**
  * When WebSocketActor subscribes to PubSub, it should automatically get unsubscribed
  * when it stops. But the Terminated message never reaches DistributedPubSubMediator.
  * I can't reproduce this in a new project but I also can't fix it here.
  * So we can send our own Unsubscribe message instead, BUT it tries to reply with an
  * UnsubscribeAck message, which is harmless but makes an annoying "dead letter" as the
  * sender has already stopped.
  *
  * So this actor exists solely to pass on the pubsub messages, and quietly ignore
  * the UnsubscribeAck.
